Java Fundamentals and OOP Project
Overview
This repository is a comprehensive Java project designed to cover a wide range of programming concepts, from basic syntax to advanced object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. It serves as a valuable resource for anyone looking to build a strong foundation in Java, whether you're a beginner or an intermediate learner aiming to enhance your skills.

Project Structure
1. Basics of Java
Syntax and Variables: Introduction to Java syntax, data types, and variable declaration.
Control Flow: Detailed examples of loops (for, while, do-while) and conditional statements (if, else, switch).
Functions: Exploration of functions, including parameter passing, return types, and method overloading.
2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Classes and Objects: Understanding classes, objects, constructors, and the significance of this keyword.
Inheritance: Demonstrates how to extend classes and the use of super keyword.
Polymorphism: Explains method overloading and overriding, and runtime vs. compile-time polymorphism.
Encapsulation: Covers access modifiers, getters, setters, and encapsulating data within a class.
Abstraction: Introduction to abstract classes and interfaces, focusing on abstract methods and multiple inheritance.
